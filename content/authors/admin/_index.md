I am a PhD candidate working in the filed of autonomous vehicle navigation in urban environments.
The focus of this research work has been on using Deep Reinforcement Learning for solving autonomous navigation problem. 
The reseach is conducted in a collaborative framework between the lab INRIA and the Mathematics, Information Science and Technology, Computer Science (MSTII) Doctoral school of the Universitiy Grenoble-Alpes (UGA), both in the beautiful city of Grenoble.
The research work is supervised by Anne Spalanzani and Dominique Vaufreydaz.

I am also a robotics software enginner with 5 years of industrial experience.
My previous work has been on mobile robot and autonomous vehicle navigation and perception, motion planning for robot manipulator and a little bit on internet of things (IOT).
